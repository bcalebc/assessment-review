    <p>Life of Pi is special to me because it is about the intersection of religion and life experience. I saw the movie for the first time in theaters with my mother!</p>
<br>
    <ol>Things I love about the movie.
      <li>There is a tiger in the movie...I love tigers.</li>
      <li>The movie seems to take an open minded view of the personal side of religion.</li>
      <li>It is an exciting adventure movie.</li>
    </ol>
